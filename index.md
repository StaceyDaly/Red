**Red Man**

I have always thought it would be fun to learn how to code, especially as my familiarity with computers dates back to when you actually needed to know some code in order to get into the programs you wanted to use, even for simple word processing. I don’t necessarily find this intimidating beyond needing to remember the codes. If you have a good source of instructions, in theory you should be able to hit the ground running. Time and patience is also important in order to head off panic! Inevitably, things do not go well he first time…or sometimes the second, third and fourth time. The drag and drop function was lost on me last week, for whatever reason.

As I sat down to begin my project for this week needing to manipulate the sphere, pilar and square, I was not sure what I wanted my scene to look like. It was then that I decided to make a face. Through trial and error, I was able to see how things moved and affected size, shape, and position. This threw me back to math class, plotting points on a grid in quadrants. Being able to “play” with the code helps tremendously as you can see how and what you are changing in real time.

Through this exercise, I am gaining a full appreciation for what coders do, and for everything that goes into the final products related to their work. I would imagine one gets “fast” at figuring out how to make things work through repetition. I fully recognize it would currently take me months to build a complex scene, but I think I would enjoy the challenge.

Building my Red Man came about by accident as I moved the square in front of the circle and suddenly thought it would make an interesting nose if it was smaller. After a great deal of trial and error, I settled on a “duck bill.” Eyes were easy, as I simply needed to replicate the code from the original sphere and make it smaller. The challenge was making the hat for his head, which basically took more patience than skill. Again, trial and error is key. Being willing to play with things until you get it right is important and is the key. What you are doing is logical, once you see how everything fits together. And seeing your final product allows you to realize what you are accomplishing.
